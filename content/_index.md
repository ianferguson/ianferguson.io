# Things That I Am Interested In

* Using technology, data & analytics to do interesting things, and to do uninteresting things better.
* Writing code that does those things, eg. [attach√©](https://github.com/datadog/attache) a multi-cloud IMDS emulation layer
* Making BBQ with a focus on pork based products and cooking with a focus on widening and improving my repertoire of vegetarian dishes.
* Max Frisch's 1971 novella, '[Man in the Holocene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74186.Man_in_the_Holocene)'
* Richard Linklater's 1991 film, '[Slacker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102943/)'
